# LangChain-Database-Chat
This project integrates LangChain, Gemini LLM, and AWS RDS to create a conversational interface for database interactions. Users can execute SQL queries and manage data using natural language commands. The system uses LangChain for query parsing, Gemini LLM for understanding user inputs, and AWS RDS for database management.
